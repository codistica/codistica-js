# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Codistica JS, please report it by sending an email to [security@codistica.com](mailto:security@codistica.com).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make Codistica JS safe for everyone.
