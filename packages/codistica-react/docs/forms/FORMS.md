# Forms

_(Work in progress.)_

### A powerful, yet simple, React props-based forms creation suite.

We know that creating good forms can be painful, but we think that forms per-se
are not the problem, but our modern expectations about forms are. Multi-step
forms, dynamically generated fields, realtime and server-side asynchronous
validation, data collection, user feedback, aesthetics... there are a lot of
things to think about, and many cannot afford such time investment.

Our forms ecosystem aims to level the playing field, giving you a high-level API
to create extremely complex forms with a minimum markup and maximum readability
following a pure React spirit (using props and composition).

**_NOTE: Features described below are still under beta development. While this
does not necessarily mean they are unstable or insecure, keep in mind general
syntax and behavior can change in the future._**
